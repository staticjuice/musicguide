# The Music Guide
The Music Guide is a website that I've been developing over the last year that aims to provide information and examples for all the genres of music we have today. There are currently 240 genres spread across 25 supergenres. Each genre contains 9 30-second samples that you can listen to, making a total of 2,160 songs in the website. Most of the research I conducted for this guide came from musicmap.info and Ishkur's Guide, so at the moment there's a lot of similarity in terms of song selection, however I will eventually make the examples more unique.

# Current issues
- World is currently empty as I'm still in the middle of researching it.

- The audio would work better if it played and buffered at the same time, eliminating the annoying delay on click. The audio is running through JavaScript so no idea how this would work at this stage.

- The site is full of lorem ipsum placeholder text. Writing all the text is going to be a huge and daunting task, so I'm not sure how I'll end up approaching this.

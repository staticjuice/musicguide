# The Music Guide
The Music Guide is a website that I've been working on since September 2016 that aims to provide information and examples of every genre of music that exists. There are currently 224 genres spread across 24 supergenres. Each genre contains nine 30-second samples you can listen to, making a total of 2016 songs in the website! Most of the research in this guide came from musicmap.info and Ishkur's Guide, so at the moment most of the song ideas came straight from those sites, however I'm slowly working to change these up.

Current issues with the project:

- The mobile version of the site is a work-in-progress. At the moment all pages should work on mobile except for the pages where you can listen to the samples.

- The site is full of lorem ipsum placeholder text. Writing all the text is going to be a huge and daunting task, so I'm not sure how I'll end up approaching this. Some of the placeholder text has been copied straight from musicmap.info as well.

- I haven't finished recording the Classical music samples yet. Some Techno samples are also missing due to confusion over the genre. However, the rest of the samples are all done.

- Some song examples may not be the best. Although I've done my best effort to make sure all the samples are accurate, there are obviously people who know way more about certain genres than me. If you see anything that looks a bit weird and out-of-place, feedback regarding this is always welcome.

- Some of the background images may have sneaky watermarks in the corner. I kinda rushed the image gathering phase, so there's always room for better images.

This website is strictly intended for educational purposes. Only small snippets of songs are used so I'm claiming everything under fair use. Please don't sue me.

# The Music Guide
The Music Guide is a website that I've been developing over the last year that aims to provide information and examples for all the genres of music we have today. There are currently 223 genres spread across 24 supergenres. Each genre contains 9 30-second samples that you can listen to, making a total of 2007 songs in the website. Most of the research I conducted for this guide came from musicmap.info and Ishkur's Guide, so at the moment there's a lot of similarity in terms of song selection, however I will eventually make the examples more unique.

# Current issues
- The site is full of lorem ipsum placeholder text. Writing all the text is going to be a huge and daunting task, so I'm not sure how I'll end up approaching this. Some of the placeholder text has been copied straight from musicmap.info as well.

- Some Techno samples are missing due to confusion over the genre. However, the rest of the samples are all done.

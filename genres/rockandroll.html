            <h1>ROCK &amp; ROLL</h1><br>

            Rock in the fifties was still in the early stages of its infancy. The first Rock genres were rather unaffiliated and came from many different origins. The precise origin of Rock ‘n’ Roll is very complex and often part of a deeper debate. Skiffle, Rockabilly and Folk Revivals are all primitive forms of Rock, showing a slow development from different paths towards a more unified sound during Rock’s Golden Age. Be that as it may, Rock ‘n’ Roll itself &ndash; the main genre &ndash; was a groundbreaking milestone. The music broke great social barriers for the first time in history. Rock ‘n’ Roll connected white cultures (especially the average middle class white American young family) with black cultures (particularly exciting black R&amp;B musicians). But Rock also connected the United Kingdom with the United States. British Skiffle was a reaction on the popularity of American Rock ‘n’ Roll. Alas, as Skiffle never broke through, Rock ‘n’ Roll became welcomed by the British, leading to British Blues Rock and the British Invasion. Last but not least, R‘n’R dissolves the musical barrier between young and old. That is to say: music expands from an adult-only form of entertainment to a vital part of any adolescent or teen life. Rock ‘n’ Roll gives the youth their own sound, their genre, their personal revolution against whatever their parents liked to listen.<br><br>

            Rock ‘n’ Roll introduces the typical Rock instrument set-up, consisting of four to five musicians (though three is possible as well): lead singer, lead guitar, rhythm guitar, drums, and bass (though the singer could also play an instrument). Rock ‘n’ Roll is based on the Jump Blues rhythm, with a heavily accentuated backbeat. Rock ‘n’ Roll is even faster than its direct predecessors Early Rhythm ‘n’ Blues and Jump Blues, with less emphasis on bass and a replacement of the double bass by the electric bass.<br><br>

            The etymology of “Rock ‘n’ Roll” reveals its subtext: the phrase is old African-American slang for sex. Of course not all Rock ‘n’ Roll songs deal about sex, but many were utterly shocking and hedonist for the conservative fifties and some artists put little effort in concealing their dirty mind. Take Jimmy Lloyd’s “Rocket in my Pocket” for example. Many parents expressed grave concerns and religious figures picked up the chant: Rock ‘n’ Roll was the music of the Devil. But forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest and Rock indulged in its own delicious aura of danger and excitement; an aura that kept lingering long after the era of Rock ‘n’ Roll. Interestingly, the term also refers to the type of dancing couples usually do on R’n’R, for example with the twist: “rocking” (dancing towards each other) and “rolling” (taking distance).<br><br>

            Rock ‘n’ Roll greatly loses its bold spirit in 1960 and the Rock craze starts to lie down. The music becomes well-behaved / politically correct and Soul takes over as the dominant music force (especially on radio and television), yet obviously lacks the characteristics of Rock ‘n’ Roll. The popularity of the “Twist”, a swinging and shaking type of dance, revives Rock in the early sixties and prevents the genre from becoming extinct before the British shape it into the rock solid foundation of popular music it has become.<br><br>

            Rock ‘n’ Roll itself has largely evaporated during consecutive decades. Apart from revivals of Rockabilly and Surf Rock in Japan, the music is mostly considered a thing of the past. However, retro interest in earlier subcultures (fashion, design, and music) of the thirties (Swing) and the fifties (Rock ‘n’ Roll) prove that Rock ‘n’ Roll can excite contemporary youth as much as it could in the fifties. Rock ‘n’ Roll after all equals tempo and energy; it compels people to lose themselves and become wild, lawless, hedonist &ndash; to become Rock and Roll.

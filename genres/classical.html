            <h1>CLASSICAL</h1>

            <p>Classical music is a towering testament to human creativity, its roots stretching deep into history and its branches reaching toward the future. Unlike fleeting musical trends, it was never designed for the moment &ndash; it was built to endure. From the sacred chants of medieval monasteries to the symphonic grandeur of the 19th century, it has constantly reinvented itself. Classical music is often thought of as rigid or old-fashioned, yet it has always been at the forefront of innovation. It introduced complex harmonies, intricate structures, and expressive depth long before other genres even existed. Even now, its influence can be heard in film scores, experimental music, and modern compositions that defy categorisation.</p>

            <p>In its earliest forms, music was communalâ€”sung in cathedrals or played at courtly gatherings. But as notation developed, so did the role of the composer, turning music from a spontaneous event into an art that could be crafted, preserved, and perfected. Unlike folk traditions, which relied on oral transmission, Classical music became a written legacy, passed down through centuries. This gave composers extraordinary control, allowing them to shape sound with mathematical precision. Yet, paradoxically, Classical music has always relied on interpretation. No two performances of a piece are exactly the same. Each conductor, each musician, even the choice of instruments can change the meaning of a composition, giving it a life beyond its original notes.</p>

            <p>If there is a single defining feature of Classical music, it is its structure. It is not built on repetition, as in Pop or Rock, but on development and contrast. A simple melody can be transformed, expanded, and reimagined, taking listeners on a journey through tension, resolution, and unexpected turns. This is why Classical compositions often feel vast and cinematic &ndash; they unfold gradually, layering themes in ways that demand patience but reward deeply. Instruments are treated as characters in a narrative, engaging in dialogue, clashing in conflict, or merging in harmony. The symphony, sonata, and concerto are not just musical forms but storytelling devices, shaping the emotional impact of a piece.</p>

            <p>Classical music has always been tied to power &ndash; whether to the church, the monarchy, or the wealthy elite who commissioned it. But it has also been an act of rebellion. Many composers lived in tension with the systems that supported them, pushing against convention in ways that often went unrecognised in their time. Bach's dense counterpoint defied simplicity, Beethoven's stormy symphonies shattered Classical restraint, and Stravinsky's rhythms caused riots. Even today, modern composers challenge expectations, incorporating electronic elements, unconventional instruments, and unorthodox structures. Though Classical music is sometimes dismissed as old-fashioned, it remains a space for radical experimentation.</p>

            <p>Perhaps the greatest paradox of Classical music is that it exists both in the past and the present. While orchestras continue to perform centuries-old masterpieces, contemporary composers are still expanding the genre's boundaries. Yet, unlike popular music, Classical does not depend on constant reinvention to stay relevant. It thrives on rediscovery. Each new generation finds its own meaning in works that have stood the test of time. Whether played in a concert hall, sampled in a Hip Hop track, or heard in the background of a film, Classical music remains a living, evolving force. It is neither static nor outdated &ndash; it is simply too vast to ever be fully contained.</p>

            <h1>METAL</h1><br>

            Although for most people Heavy Metal is (correctly) a harder and faster type of Rock, the genre is actually a continuation of “the Devil’s music”: Blues. After Metal’s experimental phase during the seventies (read more at Classic Metal), it lost a lot of its Blues influences and evolved rapidly into a variety of different styles. Two aspects of Blues have always remained however: lyrics about sorrow, nihilism, pain, tragedy, and a more concealed subtext revolving the Devil (though for Blues this was more a reputation than an actual theme). Heavy Metal expanded on these aspects in an obsessive manner. Death, destruction, corpses, zombies, Satan, pentagrams, evil themes, lots of black, torture, sharp and gothic artwork, and a hand symbol that both resembles the Devil’s horns and the letter “M”. These are the main elements of stereotypical Metal artwork/culture that have become so dominant that anything else is almost an exception to the rule. The visual language of Metal &ndash; a symbolism of anything dark or evil &ndash; transcends into corresponding fashion: black T-shirts with Metal artwork, black leather, wristbands with sharp pins, long sleazy hair, black jeans and of course: metal.<br><br>

            The term “Heavy Metal” describes well the two cornerstone aspects of the genre. It is heavy due to more amplification and distortion than Rock and it is also very “metallic”, meaning technical/rational. Heavy Metal is an overcharged engineer among genres, with highly technical unique elements such as blast beats, double bass drums, 12 string bass, lightning guitar solos and difficult voice techniques (grunting, falsetto, opera, screeching, etc.). Heavy Metal songs are usually longer than Rock songs, with more elaborate and diverse song structures. Without a radio friendly format, Metal has stayed clear from mainstream attention, although the genre is internationally well-known and connects fans across the most diverse of countries. Riffs are even more important than in Rock, and form the foundation around which many Metal songs are built. Many Metal riffs, especially early ones, make use of the Tritone: a musical dissonant interval of three whole tones that conveys a sense of restlessness. As such, the Tritone used to be associated with the Devil (Tritonus Diabolus in Musica Est) since the 18th century. What makes Metal appealing as well is a strong tendency for the theatrical. Metal likes to be bombastic to fortify its message (often of doom or evil), whether by classical elements, synth elements, more instrumentation, instrumental intermezzos, or elaborate intros.<br><br>

            “Heavy Metal” as a phrase can be traced back to Steppenwolf’s famous Hard Rock single “Born to be Wild”, in which the line “Heavy Metal Thunder” is mentioned: a quote from William S. Burroughs’ book “Naked Lunch”. After all, Heavy Metal and Hard Rock were more or less the same in the early stages of the genre.<br><br>

            Heavy Metal is extremely popular within nerd culture. This is no coincidence: Metal is music for the analytical mind; it does not simply present itself but challenges the listener to carefully dissect the overload of mid- and low-frequency aural information. In order to absorb all of the music, Metal urges to re-listen at high volume. Because nerd culture has taken an interest in Metal, it has become one of the most defined, examined and structured super-genres, with a strong hierarchical genealogy and copious (over 50) subgenres, sometimes bordering on the ludicrous. Christian Black Metal, Pirate Metal and Viking Metal are such examples. It is only a matter of time before Ninja Metal gets invented, but until then, there is already plenty to explore within one of the healthiest super-genres and with one of the most loyal fan bases. Metal has considerable overlapping with Hardcore Punk, as both genres share a love for speed and heavy guitar music. Grunge is sometimes regarded as a part of Metal as well, but this has led to a backlash of German Metal fans, who swear only by so called “True Metal”: Metal without Grunge or other crossovers.<br><br>

            Although Metal culture is (just like Hardcore Punk) largely drug-free, the average alcohol consumption tends to be much higher than within any other music culture and certain genres (Folk Metal or Viking Metal) are conceived as the perfect music to be very, very drunk to. Combined with the special Metal “dance” of head-banging, Metal is far from an introvert genre &ndash; it’s meant to bring down the house.

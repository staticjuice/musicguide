            <h1>SYNTH</h1><div class="quaternary-year experimental-light">1965</div>

            <p>At the end of the 60s, a single affordable electronic music instrument was suddenly released on the market that was able to do anything. Melody, rhythm, beats, all-in-one &ndash; it was all possible with the use of the synthesiser. The possibilities of the first synthesisers were not endless however, and some presets were more liked than others. This fact combined with the eagerness of unknown DIY-composers resulted in an avalanche of similar electronic tunes &ndash; strong, catchy melodies alternated by spacy sound effects and accompanied by synth strings or moody bass chords, either without beat or with the echoing thunder of built-in drum machines. In the 80s, this so called Synth music saw a small revival as the bass-driven and hollow sounding soundtrack for all neon-filled sci-fi films. Most of Synth was part of the so-called subgenre "Spacesynth" &ndash; music for sci-fi films or filled with space-like sounds. Synth became the favorite music for almost any late 70s and early 80s television and film theme, as it was a fairly new and unexpected sound that presented a challenge to be used for anything else.</p>

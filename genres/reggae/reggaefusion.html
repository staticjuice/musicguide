            <h1>REGGAE FUSION</h1><div class="quaternary-year reggae-light">1995</div>

            <p>In the early and mid-90s the "End-of-the-Millennium" craze led to lots of ecstatic and optimistic mainstream music. Along with Eurodance, Southern Hip Hop, Happy Hardcore and more, Reggae Fusion and Bhangramuffin scored high in the hit Pop charts. The former was a modern, electronic Rap version of Reggae music where the latter was the combination of Ragga and Bhangra. Bhangra, which is Indian Punjabi Folk music, was especially popular in the UK, where Reggae and Ragga were also an important and big subculture. Reggae Fusion, also referred to as Reggae Pop is also partly the breakthrough of Ragga in a more commercial environment. Some artists started as pure Ragga artists but changed their sound into a more politically correct and lighter version. Because of Reggae Fusion's success in the hit charts, many Reggae artists started to incorporate Ragga elements in their music. Reggae Fusion and Bhangramuffin originated in different ways, but the end result was quite similar &ndash; commercial, rhythmical, happy Reggae, which was a bit heavier and Ragga, which was a bit softer.</p>

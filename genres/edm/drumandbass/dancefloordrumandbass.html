            <h1>DANCEFLOOR D&amp;B</h1><div class="quaternary-year drumandbass-light">2004</div>

            <p>By the mid-00s, Rave was completely dead. A new subculture had learned from its mistakes. No more huge pop-up parties, and Drum &amp; Bass began to look towards other genres for inspiration. This hardcore Drum &amp; Bass was simple, purist music with 2-step drum patterns and mid-range drum frequencies. This is the mid-00s precursor to Drumstep when the familiar 2-step drum pattern (boom cha, boom-cha) started infiltrating all areas of the genre, which coincided with the replacing of the word Jungle with Drum &amp; Bass. Dancefloor D&amp;B is essentially a harder style of Drum &amp; Bass which makes ample use of electric guitars and heavy electronic melodies. It had more or less the same mentality as Nu Metal &amp; this is Rock &amp; Bass, Drum &amp; Metal, whatever you want to call it. It's Rage Against the Machine joining forces with Aphrodite to produce Dnbtron, the gestalt robot that junglists regard as both their saviour and their curse. Eventually, Nu Jump producers got influcenced by the new Dubstep craze that was emerging at the time and started making a half-time version that goes by the term "Drumstep".</p>

            <p>Speed Garage emerged in the mid-90s in the United Kingdom. It is characterised by its fusion of House music's soulful vibes with the heavier, more syncopated rhythms of Jungle and Drum &amp; Bass. Speed Garage is known for its distinctive basslines, shuffling beats, and use of time-stretched vocals. It uses a "wobble" or "warped" bass sound, which provides a deep, throbbing foundation for the tracks. Speed Garageâ€™s abundant percussion and heavy bass made the influences from Garage barely noticeable and thus was still not good enough to attract a large female crowd. The genre did however attract immediate attention from major record labels. Speed Garage had a significant impact on the UK club scene, influencing the development of related genres like 2-Step Garage and Grime. Its energetic, bass-driven style continues to be celebrated and has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, with new producers drawing inspiration from its classic sounds. The genre's ability to blend soulful elements with intense, dancefloor-ready rhythms ensures its enduring appeal.</p>

            <h1>EUROHOUSE</h1><div class="quaternary-year house-light">1989</div>

            <p>Eurohouse was a sister genre to Italo House, at least initially. At first it didn't have any specific unifying sound or technique and was generally defined as any House music coming out of mainland Europe that didn't fit anywhere else. It was mostly produced with the same Korg M1 synthesizer that delivered all those lovely piano lines (the Korg M1 dominated everything in the late 80s &ndash; together with the Roland D-50 and the Yamaha DX7 they make up the Great Triumvirate of 80s synthesizers). Around 1992, however, Eurohouse producers discovered another setting on the Korg M1 called "Organ2" which sounds nothing like a real organ but that doesn't matter because a real organ is probably not what they were looking for anyway. In musical notation it became known as the "doot" sound. The secret is to play everything in the lower register to give it a low, flat, bassy sound compared with what one would normally associate with an organ pitch-wise. This sound has seen a resurgence in recent years by House artists looking to bring back the ssound of 90s House with a more modern and polished production.</p>

            <h1>ELECTRO HOUSE</h1><div class="quaternary-year house-light">2002</div>

            <p>In the first half of the new millennium, House was almost on life support. The global conquest of Trance and Rock's reclaim as the dominant popular music genre banished it into the shadows. Yet in the darkest of times, House turned the tables by redrafting its own definition. It became what is more commonly known as "Electro", by merging Electroclash with French House and shaking off its characteristic warm, R&amp;B groove. Indeed, Electro House is harsh in comparison, due to the dirty, distorted sawtooth synth melodies and a large focus on a prominent climax. Said climax consists of a heavy bassline, intensified by postponing with a tiny bit of silence. This is known as a "drop", a musical technique which got transferred in many other types of music, especially Dubstep and Trap. Electro House is also defined by minimal use of percussion. Towards the early 2010s, the term Complextro comes into use as Electro House becomes more snappy and glitchy. However, Electro House can also be used as an umbrella term for all House genres that are directly influenced by it.</p>

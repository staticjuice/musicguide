            <h1>PROGRESSIVE HOUSE</h1><div class="quaternary-year house-light">1992</div>

            <p>There are actually two waves of Progressive House. The first wave arrived in the mid-90s &ndash; long, atmospheric tracks with lots of hyper-rhythmic percussion and primarily UK-based. Highly confusing, this new genre was sometimes called "Trance" at the time, as Trance hadn't established itself as a genre yet. The second wave took hold during the 2000s. Percussion and bass became heavier, but not more complex. Dynamic range also got toned down, with all the sound frequencies lying closer together. Songs became even longer and are more often the work of relatively unknown DJs instead of album-orientated bands, aimed at long, progressing DJ sets. This second wave was mainly the reaction on another House subgenre &ndash; Eurodance, which is a soft, female-orientated, lightweight type of Dance music in the mid-90s. Clearly the opposite in sound, Progressive House tries to please its target audience with its never-ending easy-to-mix pumping sound. And it worked due to a certain notion of sophistication and technology, though its name discloses rather an air of condescension.</p>

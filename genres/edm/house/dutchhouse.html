            <h1>DUTCH HOUSE</h1><div class="quaternary-year house-light">2009</div>

            <p>The second wave of Electro House was known as Dutch House, also known as Dirty Dutch, because it came primarily from the Netherlands. This subgenre of House music is characterised by its high energy and distinctive sound, often featuring squeaky, high-pitched synths and strong, driving basslines. The tempo is typically faster than traditional House music, usually around 130 BPM, which contributes to its intense, dancefloor-ready vibe. The sound of Dutch House is influenced by the minimalist approach of Techno, combined with the melodic elements of Electro House. Producers like Chuckie, Afrojack, and Sidney Samson are notable figures who helped shape and popularise the sound. Their tracks often incorporate catchy, repetitive hooks and build-ups that lead to explosive yet anticlimactic drops, designed to create maximum impact in a club setting. Dutch House later started to incorporate elements of Reggaeton music, eventually giving rise to Moombahton. This fusion gives Dutch House its unique, eclectic appeal, making it a staple in festivals and dance clubs worldwide.</p>

                <h1>DRUM &amp; BASS</h1>

                <p>Drum &amp; Bass is arguably the deepest of all supergenres. It is a rolling and thundering sound of breakbeats and basslines, like the ominous distant rumble of a jungle stampede. (Modern) Drum &amp; Bass is too complex to create without the use of advanced music software, which explains why it's one of the youngest supergenres. In the early days, there was a difference between Drum &amp; Bass and Jungle. Despite a select number of fans refusing to disregard that difference, the terms have become interchangeable over the course of time. Jungle is the voice of the black British youth &ndash; therefore its ties with both Hip Hop and Reggae music genres come as no surprise.</p>

                <p>The noun Drum &amp; Bass suggests a combination of two styles, one part drum, one part bass. History teaches that this actually is more truth than fiction &ndash; early Drum &amp; Bass originates by manually mixing two compatible records from different genres, both highly sped-up. One record often provides samples to create a heavily-accelerated breakbeat such as the Amen Break, dubplates and Breakbeat Hardcore records. The other a subsonic bassline such as Industrial Techno or Rave. Most Drum &amp; Bass songs use the Amen Break or Funky Drummer Break as template for their 4/4 breakbeat. Snare drums are placed at the second and fourth beat of a bar. Drum &amp; Bass has a very high speed, ranging between 160-190 BPM. Combined with the use of breakbeats, such high speeds make D&amp;B instantaneously recognizable.</p>

                <p>Drum &amp; Bass uses many special techniques to create a menacing but futuristic sound. Time-stretching (speeding up certain parts of the tracks without changing the pitch), half-speed basslines (decreasing speed and pitch to create deepness), rolling basslines (eliminating silent spaces between bass notes), and the "Drop" &ndash; launching the main part of the song, but more layered and heavier, after breakdowns and long ascending build-ups. The key difference between Breakbeat and Drum &amp; Bass is that Breakbeat tries to sound "natural" and "organic", imitating a real drummer. Drum &amp; Bass on the other hand, abandons all realism and attempts to create the opposite &ndash; synthetic, futuristic and technologic.</p>

                <p>Whereas "Drum &amp; Bass" is rather self-explanatory, the name "Jungle" requires further explaining &ndash; apparently, Jungle is derived from the jungle-like Tivoli Gardens in Jamaica, of which a referring sample occurs in an early Jungle track from Rebel MC. However, countless other explanations are circulating among journalists and enthusiasts, obscuring the truth while strengthening the symbolic value of Jungle's name.</p>

                <p>Jungle has always had two faces, which is part of the early difference between Jungle and Drum &amp; Bass. After the great era of Rave, the whole of Dance music polarized into two opposite universes, not the least noticeable within Drum &amp; Bass. On one side, there's an intelligent / sophisticated / ambient / progressive approach of the music (Old Skool D&amp;B, Jazzstep, Liquid, Dubstep, UKG, Broken Beats), where on the other hand there's a hardcore / rave / extravert / linear approach (Ragga Jungle, Breakbeat Hardcore, Darkcore, Hardstep, Techstep, Jump Up, Post-Dubstep). But these poles obviously influence each other and sometimes cross over. It is this golden combination of complex rhythms combined with deep, threatening basses that makes Drum &amp; Bass so popular. Jungle's sound matches its interwoven sense of militant protest (similar to Reggae or Hip Hop). It combines the attractiveness of "dangerous" Rave with the sophistication of experimental "intelligent" Dance genres &ndash; Jungle is a voodoo priest in the shadows &ndash; a sinister mastermind.</p>

                <p>In current times, it has become very difficult or even pointless to separate Hardstep, Techstep, Darkstep and Neurofunk. These genres are deliberately separately mentioned in the guide to show the size and evolution of Drum &amp; Bass, but nowadays they have more or less become one, referred to as Darkside. Darkside is &ndash; besides Dubstep &ndash; one of the three contemporary Drum &amp; Bass schools, alongside Liquid and (Nu) Jump Up.</p>

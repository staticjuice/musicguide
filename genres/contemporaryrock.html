            <h1>CONTEMPORARY ROCK</h1><br>

            For the lack of a proper name, “Contemporary” Rock signifies all new Rock genres in the 21st century. Although this may sound like a meaningless term for the sake of creating a false portmanteau, Contemporary Rock genres share common characteristics, though not technical ones. Generally speaking, two dominant forces control and shape the rise of these genres (and not only in the world of Rock music): recycling and eclecticism. Cut-and-paste techniques form new genres out of old ones. Choice is power and originality/experimentation is overrated. Rock bands focus on the quality of their music and the search of a personal sound, instead of desperately christening a new crusade in the form of genre. The great boom of music genres in the nineties (not only EDM, but also Indie) must undoubtedly have led to genre fatigue and escapism in unclassifiable sound, of which “contra-genres” such as Witch House are the physical proof. Indeed, one might argue that in the 21st century, genre has become alternative or obscure, and fusion has become mainstream.<br><br>

            A technical definition of Contemporary Rock is lacking. The genre uses different influences to create a new concept of Rock music. Synthesizers &ndash; once revolutionary and exciting &ndash; have become an ordinary Rock instrument like guitar or drums. With influences from Pop, Electronic and even Folk, anything is possible. One could say that Contemporary Rock is defined by being any kind of Rock different from the past. But not even this is true, as Garage Rock and Post-Punk revivals form the exception to that rule.<br><br>

            The power of Contemporary Rock lies in reaching out and building bridges towards other music genres. The age of subcultural niches (us against them) has ceased. The era of genre competition has faded. The ambiguous non-genre “Mash-Up” is a striking example of this; Mash-Up combines all kinds of genres into an eclectic mix, full of surprises and a deliberate mashing of unrelated styles.<br><br>

            Around 1999-2002, Dance becomes more popular than (Alternative) Rock, instilling fear in the hearts of many Rock enthusiast. Yet at the beginning of the millennium (around 2003-2004), Contemporary Rock proved powerful enough to push Dance music back underground. Today the genre remains a powerhouse among popular music, although Contemporary Rock and the arrival of ever more music streaming apps and websites already hint that in the future there will be no more genre monopoly, but a rather equal spread of popularity among all genres, whichever ones that may be.<br><br>

            It is at the very least striking to see that in a society with abundant injustice (financial crisis, climate change, terrorism, racism and migration problems, energy crisis, growing income gap,…), new protest music genres embedded in reactionary subcultures fail to emerge. This may only be explained through the even larger impact on artists of countering forces in contemporary society: globalization, mass-communication, secularisation, techno-materialism, encapsulation, and isolation. But Rock must not take the fall for these contemporary behavioural patterns. All super-genres struggle to bring purist styles to the table and to maintain the confined identity they once had. However, if there is one thing Contemporary Rock and consorts such as Mash-Up can teach us, is that we should regard all popular music as one big, indestructible family instead of a list of groups: an intricate network of nodes &ndash; a constellation of sound.

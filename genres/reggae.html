            <h1>REGGAE</h1>

            <p>Jamaican music is regrettably often reduced to its most popular export Reggae. Reggae's international appeal quickly surpassed the threshold which defines World music. This becomes very clear when compared to the music of neighbouring countries like Cuba and Haiti. But there are more Jamaican music genres that all have become more popular than World music. What is even more important than their popularity is the fact that Reggae creates a critical shackle between Rock, Rap and Dance. Almost all Reggae genres share certain characteristics which not only give them a very distinguishable sound but also explain the tremendous influence on other genres, particularly British ones. As Jamaica used to be a British colony until 1962 (which is after the rise of Ska), the import of Reggae into the UK has always been thriving (like the cargos from the infamous Trojan record label for example).</p>

            <p>Jamaica had no radio stations at all let alone music television. The only way for the Jamaican public to enjoy music they didn't have to buy themselves, was by attending local "sound systems" &ndash; very large, mobile stereo systems with different types of speakers and turntables. To supply these sound systems with records, there were recording studios everywhere. Therefore, Reggae is focused on recording, not performing. Live gigs were virtually non-existent and vinyl reigned supreme. It is no wonder that many pioneering recording and loudspeaker techniques were invented in Jamaica. Because of sound systems, Reggae is made to be played outdoors (with the exception of Dancehall). This is particularly noticeable in the dedication (mainly amplification) on the drum and bass parts. Unsurprisingly, Reggae has always been extremely popular at festivals abroad, which helped Reggae's popularity move forward.</p>

            <p>The Jamaican culture of record producing and spontaneous sound systems has been around as long as the music itself, i.e. even as early as Mento. This means that Jamaica also introduced the concept of the DJ long before Disco, Hip Hop and EDM. The "Disk Jockey" or record player is known as the "Selecta" or selector. The DJ works together with the "MC" or "Master of Ceremonies", who does the "toasting" &ndash; Jamaican slang for adding live vocals. The MC also provides "peps", which are speedy vocals in a Jamaican dialect (that may sound like gibberish) to pep up the crowd, later annexed by Drum &amp; Bass. In the beginning, the Selector and the MC was one and the same person, but as these two occupations became separated from each other, their respective responsibility increased. Sound systems expanded as well, evolving in more than just a big piece of equipment. They became a treasured relic for a posse of involved artists and technicians. Such sound system posses regularly held battles against each other, to see who had the best records, mixing skills or toasting talents. More often than not, these battles escalated in a hail of violence &ndash; imagine two neighbourhood street parties of feuding families shooting at each other.</p>

            <p>Another characteristic of all Reggae music is a strong emphasis on the offbeat. This gives the music a laidback sound, ideal for warm outdoor weather and smoking marijuana. Indeed, cannabis &ndash; cultivated on Jamaica itself &ndash; is also partly responsible for the way most Jamaican music sounds, although its influence on the genre must not be exaggerated.</p>

            <p>Besides all technical elements that define Reggae, there are other elements which have become a custom overseas, leading to Jamaican or Reggae subcultures in various other countries. Jamaican coloured artwork (red-yellow-green), similar fashion or dreadlocks as a haircut for example. Dreadlocks were originally a Rastafarian symbol of spirituality, rebellion, individualism and proudness of race (as dreadlocks are something other races cannot so easily obtain). Jamaican music, after all, is more about non-conformity and originality than anything else. Jamaicans only play what they like. If it is not how they want it, they alter it. If it stops being made, they make it themselves. If it doesn't exist, they invent it. Unfortunately, the island has ceased to produce any truly original genres since Ragga. Yet one would do well to keep a close eye on any music it brings forth.</p>

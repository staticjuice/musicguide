            <h1>DIXIELAND</h1><div class="quaternary-year jazz-light">1912</div>

            <p>The very first type of Jazz was played in the background of bars (barrelhouses), brothels, and cabarets by a small band. It first appeared in New Orleans thanks to the melting pot present of Ragtime, Ha√Øtian Folk, Creole Folk and Country Blues. The music was not rough and emotional like Blues, but balanced and reserved. The basic instrument ensemble for Dixieland is trumpet, clarinet and trombone &ndash; a very modest but complementary trio, filling all frequencies and improvising around each other. No instrument dominates &ndash; they all communicate and play out their melodies at each other in a counterpoint manner. The technique of counterpoint came into Jazz through Cuban Contradanza music, which in turn came from French Contredanse. All three instruments also improvise collectively instead of separately, an important difference with later Jazz. Improvisation and experimentation were common in Jazz and stimulated by frequent marijuana use, as the drug was still legal in the US during the 1910s and 20s. After a while, Jazz bands expanded, leading to a slightly different sound featuring more instruments.</p>

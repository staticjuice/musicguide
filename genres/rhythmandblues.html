            <h1>R&amp;B</h1>

            <p> As the name implies, Rhythm &amp; Blues ("R&amp;B") is the powerful combination of two old music genres. Gospel (the Rhythm) on one hand, which provides an infectious groovy tempo that was already noticeable in its early barbershop days with handclapping and rhythmical vibrating voices. Blues on the other hand, which delivers warm chords and rich bass. "Gospel &amp; Blues" combines diverse musical elements and is, therefore, a highly flexible hybrid genre, forming a bridge between many supergenres. R&amp;B can be the middle ground between Blues and Rock, but also between Hip Hop and Pop or Gospel and House, which makes it one of the most accessible music genres.</p>

            <p>The cornerstone aspect of all R&amp;B is the backbeat &ndash; the 2nd and 4th beat of each bar becomes accentuated, creating a strong cadence. Backbeat makes R&amp;B highly danceable, eventually leading to Disco and the concept of nightlife dance culture and clubbing. R&amp;B is also known for more complex rhythms and drums &ndash; the introduction of the breakbeat or a high emphasis on percussion. Instrumentation follows out of the basic Blues setup &ndash; guitar, bass and drums. Yet almost always one or more instruments are added, selected by their ability to create a richer sound and radiate a warm, cosy feeling &ndash; violins, synth, vibraphone, Hammond organ or brass horns.</p>

            <p>Although R&amp;B is rather a diverse collection of genres, the common themes of optimism, love and joy recur in all of them. A positive vibe, amplified by invigorating performances by artists with a charismatic, radiant appearance, makes R&amp;B among the most popular of genres. Such joy is a clear rupture with R&amp;B's predecessor, Blues. Some smaller exceptions (Early R&amp;B, Doo-Wop) and one big one (Disco) put aside, all R&amp;B can be divided into three strong families even more known than R&amp;B itself &ndash; Soul, Funk and Urban.</p>

            <p>Soul is a secular and more Pop-orientated continuation of Gospel &ndash; gentle and emotional songs (usually about love) with high production values but even more benevolent willpower. Soul refers to a personal quality of high morality &ndash; a Soul person is a righteous being. Soul was the dominant mainstream music genre in the first half of the 60s and remained popular ever since. With multiple subgenres and three revivals (Neo Soul, Vintage Soul Revival and Future Soul), it is clear to see that Soul's strength has barely diminished.</p>

            <p>Funk evolves out of Soul but reaches out to Jazz and a bit of Rock to create even more rhythmical music, based on a single chord. Funk brings a repetitive pulsing groove around which every song is built, making the genre more dance-friendly than Soul. Funk likes to use electric bass or electro-synth distortions to create a "greasy" sound, while the percussion section is hardly distinguishable from the melody or bass section &ndash; all the instruments have become one &ndash; the Funk groove. The word funk is derived from old slang for the smell of sex &ndash; enough said. Many Funk subgenres have emerged and recent revivals prove an undying popularity, although Funk has never been mainstream or underground &ndash; it knows exactly how to stay on the edge of the spotlights. Something that could not be said of Disco &ndash; a blend of Funk and Soul that takes over the entire popular music scene in the late 70s.</p>

            <p>Urban is the latest development of R&amp;B, where it blends with Hip Hop, Pop and a bit of Latin into a fusion that should function equally well for nightclubbing, album sales, live concerts or radio performances. Therefore Urban has become a very dominant music genre and often criticised for commercialism and shallowness. The word urban comes from the "Urban Pop" radio format, where the latest forms of R&amp;B are played that are the most suitable for going-out (in city clubs, hence urban). As a result of Urban's popularity, the general term R&amp;B became synonymous with Urban and for many (young) people, these two genres are misinterpreted as one and the same. But real Rhythm &amp; Blues is an immensely large and diverse music family &ndash; a lineage with a tremendous passion and respect for its own productions, and usually with an almost obligatory request to get up and move.</p>

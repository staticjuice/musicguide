                <h1>HARDCORE</h1>

                <p>Originally, Hardcore was a subgenre of Techno, but one strongly influenced by (Acid) House (thus being a hybrid). When compared to other EDM supergenres, Hardcore has no clear start but is the result of a gradual evolution. It is characterized by being harder, darker and faster than regular Techno, in which there (literally) is no more room for Funk/Electro basslines. This evolution was spearheaded by the steep rise of XTC (and in lesser extent amphetamines), founded in early Acid House/Madchester club culture. Though Hardcore can take on a greater variety of forms than most people suspect, the common factor has been consistent throughout its history &ndash; sheer ecstasy; an intense rush preferably shared with a massive crowd to intensify even more. Where (regular) Techno has a built-in restraint for the formulaic and House tries to please as many as possible, Hardcore is without compromise. It can be silly, cheesy, thundering, ruthless, ridiculous, exaggerated or all of the above, marketing itself to a much narrower niche of listeners. However, in turn these listeners are grateful for providing such traits eschewed by other Dance genres and thereby form a loyal fan base &ndash; a smaller but harder core.</p>

                <p>A very distinguishable feature of Hardcore is that it is (usually) a lot faster than other Dance music, starting from 150-160 BPM and sometimes even reaching 1000 BPM (which results in a single tone). If it's not particularly fast, like New Beat or the First Wave of Rave, it is definitely much harder and more menacing than other Dance music, favouring sound distortions and very deep bass. Hardcore seldom uses melodies, but relies on a composition of synth stabs to create melodic treble. Similar to Punk's power chords, synth stabs create a "broken" but more powerful and energetic feel. Uniquely, Hardcore can either have a steady, hyper-fast four-to-the-floor beat, which includes the most well-known genres, or a breakbeat in the form of more obscure fusions with Jungle and Breakbeat.</p>

                <p>The psychoactive effect of XTC on music listening has probably been the main contributor of Hardcore Techno's entire development. In high dosages, the drug pushes the music more to the background while tightening the senses and thereby creating a craving for more intense and ecstatic music. As the average XTC consumption grew larger and larger (especially in the Netherlands), Hardcore's sound altered too. Until the tempo and heaviness became too much, and slowly Hardcore geared down again. Despite heavy XTC and amphetamine use, there are a significant amount of drug-free fans, some even straight-edge. For these people, music simply cannot be intense enough and Hardcore provides something no other genre can deliver.</p>

                <p>Hardcore Techno can be divided into two large music groups &ndash; Rave XL and Gabber XL. The first group, the collection of Rave genres (New Beat, true Hardcore Techno, Darkcore, Breakbeat Hardcore, Free Tekno, Acidcore, etc.) is an even more well-known phenomenon than the encompassing supergenre Hardcore. Its excesses reached large media coverage during Rave's peak years (1990-1992). Rave started Hardcore's culture of massive parties (known as "Raves" ) filled with wild, exuberant people and all kinds of silly extravaganza. Yellow smileys, candy colors, bubble solution, glow sticks, whistles, sunglasses at night and oversized clothing &ndash; anything goes in the world of Rave.</p>

                <p>The second music group, Gabber and related Hard Dance genres (early Gabber, Speedcore, Terrorcore, Nu Style, Hardstyle, Jumpstyle), took a more serious but also more extreme approach. It concentrated on the (intensity of the) music and shielding off its culture from outsiders. Moving pop-up raves became replaced by smaller and fixed (club) parties, but eventually mega dance events returned the spirit of ecstatic Rave. Gabber XL (in the broad sense) survived by transmuting into a more accessible style, influenced by Hard Dance. There's a large but interesting obscure area of crossover styles between Hardcore and other EDM genres. Hardstyle, Jumpstyle and Tekstyle now hold Hardcore's key to the future. But in these eclectic times, constrained supergenres seem highly unlikely. Which is a good thing considering Rave and Gabber have already penetrated the outer limits of the Dance galaxy and sown the seeds of Hardcore.</p>

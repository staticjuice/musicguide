            <h1>COUNTRY</h1><br>

            For many non-Americans unfamiliar with the music, Country feels like a small and insignificant genre. However, Country has been the United States’ most selling genre for several decades and still is among the top selling categories according to numerous statistics. During the seventies, American citizens could even tune in to more than 600 (!) different Country radio stations. The genre has always been closely linked with radio and was one of the first music genres to go on the airwaves and into the living room of many Americans. Because that’s what Country is all about: everyday life, family, home. It is no coincidence many Country bands are named as a family and/or are actual families. Strong family values form a common theme throughout Country’s history, but sometimes a darker reality of liquor, drugs, adultery and criminal behavior dispels that picture perfect illusion. Then, such a predicament becomes a catalyst that creates diversity within the genre. But Country deals about more than just family. God and the motherland form two other recurring core values of Country’s content. The lyrical subject of faith has created a link with Gospel (Country Gospel), and a distance with people of other religions.<br><br>

            Being as old as it is, Country works mostly with very classic (string) instruments: banjo, fiddle, acoustic guitar, violin and harmonica. The genre has refrained during later decades from incorporating many other instruments, especially electronic ones. With a slow tempo and a sparse (often acoustic) set-up, Country puts great emphasis on voice. Many male and female Country singers are renowned for their voice, perhaps the most important instrument of the genre. Just like Folk Rock, the voice should have the power to convey emotional stories or ballads. Duets, especially man and woman talking about love, are also common within the genre. Country is based on traditional ballads or tunes with rather plain melodies and chords, similar to Folk music (which was an important influence on the genre).<br><br>

            Because Country can be traced back to remote, wild, rural areas, the name is a reminder of its geographical origin. But Country quickly conquered the urban landscape, like Nashville, Tennessee, where the mythical Grand Ole Opry dance hall showcased all kinds of Country genres every week from 1925 until this very day. The word “Country” also hints at the patriotism embedded in Country’s subculture. A strong link with American culture and the pride of the nation give Country a strong domestic appeal, but a weak foreign one. However, certain Country songs and artists have become immensely popular overseas and show just how much power and emotion can be transferred throughout the genre.<br><br>

            A particular aspect of Country is that all its singers are white: it is the Caucasian equivalent of the Blues - the music of one stereotypical image: the common, traditional, Christian, American man. The two primordial billboard music categories left no doubt about this: popular music was either “race music” (made by blacks: Blues and black Jazz) or “hillbilly music” (made by whites: Country). Country subculture is often very conservative and sometimes accused of homophobic or racist incidents such as worshipping of the southern – slave - Confederacy. Yet the genre is far too broad and rich to narrow it down to its most politically extreme exponents.<br><br>

            A possible subdivision is the use of generations because Country is so family related. These (six) generations are often real family generations (famous Country singer Hank Williams and his almost equally famous son Hank Williams Jr. for example). The first and second generation are sometimes known as “Traditional Country”. The hegemony of Rock within white music culture prevents a large mainstream breakthrough of Country, especially on an international scale. But the unique and powerful characteristics of the genre grant Country still a strong appeal, almost a century long.

            <p>With the arrival of early home computers and the first game consoles, a weird and particular kind of music was born &ndash; electronic music made for electronic games. Because of primitive chips and hardware, this music had to be small in data and was therefore by default minimalistic, lo-fi and consisting of recurring parts. Often it was barely more than a catchy, high-frequency melody and a single rhythmic bass chord produced by a small sound chip. The result is an extremely primitive sound, but that didn't matter as early computers or arcade consoles had low-quality speakers anyway. However, during the coming decades, countless artists were drawn to the sound and started to make their own game music &ndash; without games. At first Video Game Music consisted primarily of two subgenres &ndash; very basic 8-bit music and the slightly more advanced 16-bit, which allowed for a richer and more layered sound, though still very rudimentary. Although this genre might seem unimportant, the technology itself brought forth lots of other instruments and influenced a lot of other electronic music.</p>

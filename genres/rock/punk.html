            <h1>PUNK</h1>

            <p>Punk, Post-Punk and New Wave form a well-documented chapter in the history of Rock, probably because the protagonists show so much evolution in such a short period. What started as the plainest and purest form of Rock, changed into a conceptual movement embracing the eccentric. In the beginning Punk formed the antipode for what New Wave would later become &ndash; mass-appeal, interest from adults, heavy post-production, stardom, eclecticism. The same trademarks of Stadium Rock from the early 70s which fueled Punk's revolt in the first place. Rock had lost all connection with the young crowd and a return to the roots was far past due.</p>

            <p>Punk mentality goes back beyond the 70s &ndash; the concept of short, powerful riffs and brief, energetic songs can be traced to the roots of Power Pop. So-called "power chords" not only form the basis for Punk but even became parodied in a famous quote by Punk magazine Sniffin' Glue &ndash; "Here's a chord. Here's another one. That's three. Now go and form a band!" This quote reveals much about the amateurism of early Punk Rock bands. Punk was almost a statement about ineptitude &ndash; anyone could do it. And indeed, some famous artists couldn't even read notes or barely play guitar. As a living paradigm of protest, Punk knew how to bring music back to the youth &ndash; raw, sincere, lo-fi, spontaneous. This is very similar to what happened in Jamaica around the same time &ndash; Punk and Reggae were brothers in arms, protesting against authority and returning music to the streets. Punk is Robin Hood in leather and pins. A culture of DIY and sleaziness (drugs, vandalism, squatting, riots, graffiti) blends in with such epitome of enfant terrible, made by and for "punks" &ndash; kids who are up to no good. And this is what has made Punk attractive during all these years. Just like Garage Rock and Grunge, Punk is raw &ndash; the shredded remains of all eclectic and "intellectual" Rock genres down the meat grinder.</p>

            <p>Technically, Punk uses a faster tempo than most Rock genres with sparse instrumentation. Chords are simple but powerful and vocals are usually with a small dynamic range, except when screamed. But Post-Punk and New Wave use more extensive song structure, vocal range and instrumentation. A technical common ground seems therefore far off. What binds these different styles is the power of ideas and a strong emphasis on the visual, particularly fashion. The whole era of Punk and New Wave is dominated by powerful imagery, shocking personalities and new technology. Both Punk and New Wave focus on concept and message. These are not songs about everyday life or personal feelings. Punk and New Wave are about the fabric of society in a pessimistic, cynical, undermining or melancholic manner.</p>

            <p>The genealogy of Punk and New Wave starts with a scattered plethora of Punk subgenres, such as Queercore, Cowpunk, Gypsy Punk, Riot Grrrl, Celtic Punk, Street Punk, Art Punk, Oi!-Punk, Skate Punk, Pop Punk, Psychobilly, Ska Punk, etc. Punk becomes almost a one-size-fits-all suffix. The viability of every crossover is put to the test and only the most influential or durable are listed in the guide. Retrospectively, Punk branched into two large music streams &ndash; Hardcore Punk and Post-Punk/New Wave. When New Wave starts to embrace the synthesiser and crosses over to Pop (i.e. Synthpop), it suppresses Post-Punk and pushes it underground (into Gothic/Industrial). Although Synthpop and New Wave might differ greatly from Punk, they use similar concepts of Dadaism and collage as well as expanding these concepts to art forms beyond music, e.g. fashion and performance art. Industrial (and Gothic) inherited Punk/New Wave's intrusion of reality, taking over as popular music's ultimate insurgent.</p>

            <p>Hardcore Punk evolved out of the dominant musical era of Punk Rock in the late 70s. When the 80s arrived, many artists were fed up with Punk's excesses (or at least Punk's reputation as media liked to exaggerate on its scandals), or else they were disillusioned by the evaporation of Punk's political message. What started as merely a subgenre of Punk (among many others), grew exponentially both in the US and the UK. Technically, Hardcore is based on Punk Rock, but much faster and with shorter, bursting songs. It's like a Punk Rock song of three or four minutes is compressed in a time span of less than two minutes. Such high speed has obviously an effect on voice &ndash; Hardcore vocalists shout with short bursting strokes, almost like an army sergeant. Hardcore is more defined within its lifestyle &ndash; a subculture of discipline and purity. Many Hardcore bands and fans live by a strict anti-hedonist code, with no drugs, healthy food, bald or shaven haircut, jeans and shirts, and badges or pins marking honour and respect. A strong sense of community and pride sways over Hardcore culture, with recurring mottos like "Hardcore Will Never Die". Hardcore works largely with small record labels, or band members release their very own record label. Artists become entrepreneurs and distance themselves from capitalism. With the help of local support, such as T-shirt sales, they manage to survive and maintain their musical integrity.</p>

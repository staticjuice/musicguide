            <p>Screamo is a genre derived from Post-Hardcore, specifically the Emocore sound that evolved during that era. Though initial bands began appearing around this time, it wasn’t until the 2000s that many had entered mainstream consciousness. After the turn of the millennium, the music was generally based in the aggressive side of the overarching Emo scene. Even bands that weren’t necessarily Screamo would often delve into the genre’s characteristic guttural vocal style not so dissimilar from the abrasive nature of Hardcore. It came to be that the soft/loud dynamic of having either one or two singers who alternate between passionate singing and distraught shrieking characterises most Screamo. These vocals are often layered or appear side-by-side amid aggressive, hard-hitting guitar licks used to trigger an exhaustive, emotional catharsis. Though the music is outwardly tough and powerful, the lyrics are usually of the introspective kind found in softer Emo bands. For many groups, lyrics often boasted violent or bloody imagery alongside subject matter dealing with overwhelming angst and relationships.</p>

            <p>Proto-Punk refers to a small group of groundbreaking, largely uncategorisable bands who began to emerge in the late 60s, up to the point when Punk itself became a phenomenon. Obviously, none of these artists could be classified as Proto-Punk until long after the fact &ndash; it was never a cohesive movement, nor was there a readily identifiable Proto-Punk sound that made its artists seem related at the time. What ties Proto-Punk together is a certain provocative sensibility that didn't fit the prevailing counterculture of the time. Proto-Punk challenged not only mainstream Rock conventions but the utopianism and general positivity of the hippie movement. It was consciously subversive and fully aware of its outsider status. In terms of its lasting influence, much Proto-Punk was primitive and stripped-down, even when it wasn't aggressive, and its production was usually just as unpolished. The first Proto-Punk group was The Velvet Underground, for a variety of reasons &ndash; their boundary-shattering lyrical content, their use of feedback, distortion and their amateurish technique.</p>

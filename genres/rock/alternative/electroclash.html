            <h1>ELECTROCLASH</h1><div class="quaternary-year alternative-light">1997</div>

            <p>Twenty years after its arrival, Synthpop was badly due for a comeback. Probably because people were fed up with the same Dance beat being recycled in unending ways. The great EDM revolution was past its peak and not interesting anymore. A return to the experimental approach of synthesizer sound, the submissive role of the beat, artsy lyrics and a heavy focus on image, design and fashion were the key ingredients that could barely disguise this genre as something new (though there was of course an evolution of instruments, computers and influences from House noticeable). Indeed, Electroclash is Synthpop version 2.0 and righteously referred to as "Nu Wave". But originality wasn’t the point. Electroclash was music of fun and nonsense, that didn’t desperately try to be innovative or revolutionary. A testament that the new millennium (and Dance along with it) hadn’t changed the world and that it didn’t matter. Electroclash is often also marked as the start of retro-futurism, with themes of coldness, isolation and alienation. A theme further expanded by Synthwave and Vaporwave.</p>

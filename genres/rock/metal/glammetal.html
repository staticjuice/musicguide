            <p>Glam Metal is a derisive term applied to the slick, pretty and Pop-orientated Heavy Metal bands of the late 80s. These bands expanded the approach of the loud but safe Heartland Rock bands, only they had a more distinctive visual image because they were living in the post-MTV era. Wearing flashy clothing, heavy makeup and large, teased hair, the bands had an appearance that was more distinctive than their music. Long-haired male bands made commercial Metal songs with Pop-like feelgood tunes, to guarantee themselves some airtime. Glam Metal was one of the few music genres that got played a lot during the first years of MTV, which further expanded the fame of these artists. Unfortunately, this airtime was not used to promote the music but the private parts of the band. The initial protest was minimal though, as it was hard to take a band in black leather and excessive makeup seriously. Almost all famous Glam Metal bands were based in Los Angeles, where a subculture of stardom allures promiscuity and heroin abuse, paving the surface of Sunset Boulevard.</p>

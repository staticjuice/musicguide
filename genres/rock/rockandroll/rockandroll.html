            <h1>ROCK &amp; ROLL</h1><div class="quaternary-year rockandroll-light">1954</div>

            <p>Rock &amp; Roll was musically speaking not a big step forward &ndash; its origins in Boogie Woogie and R&amp;B were obvious. It was mainly a racial thing &ndash; young, attractive, white singers bringing black music into the living rooms of white people and turning heads by shaking their pelvis. At the same time, Country musicians became influenced by early Blues and created uptempo Country with a strong beat, slapped upright bass and stuttering vocals &ndash; Rockabilly. Rock &amp; Roll often overlaps with Rockabilly's simple, uptempo Blues with three chords and the holy instrument trinity of Rock &ndash; drums, guitar and bass. As one can see, early Rock &amp; Roll was difficult to separate from early R&amp;B. However, the often-overlooked effect of amphetamine changed the sound into the sociocultural revolution that it was &ndash; with their trembling voices, exuberant behaviour, unbridled energy and sexual innuendo, they introduced something new and unheard of. White teens went crazy around the world and soon Rock &amp; Roll became so popular that the term was used for anything rebellious, and often Rock music in general.</p>

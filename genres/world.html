            <h1>WORLD</h1>

            <p>World music is a musical category encompassing many different styles of music from around the globe, which includes many genres including some forms of Western music represented by Folk music, but for the purposes of this guide, the definition will be primarily focused on selected forms of ethnic music, indigenous music and neotraditional music. The term "World music" was popularized in the 1980s as a marketing category for non-Western traditional music. Since then, globalization has facilitated the expansion of World music's audiences and scope, and it has grown to include hybrid subgenres such as World fusion, global fusion, ethnic fusion and Worldbeat.</p>

            <p>In the age of digital music production the increased availability of high-quality, ethnic music samples, sound bites and loops from every known region are commonly used in commercial music production, which has exposed a vast spectrum of indigenous music texture to developing, independent artists. These influences proliferate quickly in a web-based music industry that is now percolating as a much larger, predominantly self-promoted menu, via an increasing number of indie-artist-friendly, streaming Internet options, such as Last.fm, Rhapsody, Live365, Jango Artist Airplay and ReverbNation.</p>

            <p>Similar terminology between distinctly different sub-categories under primary music genres, such as World, Rock and Pop can be as ambiguous and confusing to industry moguls as it is to consumers. This is especially true in the context of World music, where branches of ethnically influenced Pop trends are as genre-defined by consumer perception as they are by the music industry forums that govern the basis for categorical distinction. Academic scholars tend to agree that, in today's world of consumer music reviews and blogging, global music culture's public perception is what ultimately distils a prevailing basis for definition from genre ambiguity, regardless of how clearly a category has been outlined by corporate marketing forums and music journalism. The World music genre's gradual migration from a clear spectrum of roots music traditions to an extended list of hybrid subgenres is a good example of the motion genre boundaries can exhibit in a globalizing Pop culture.</p>

            <p>Examples of popular forms of World music include the various forms of non-European classical music (e.g. Japanese and Chinese koto music, Indian raga music, Tibetan chants), Eastern European Folk music (e.g. the village music of the Balkans, The Mystery Of The Bulgarian Voices), Nordic folk music and the many forms of folk and tribal music of the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America, and Indonesian music.</p>

            <p>The broad category of World music includes isolated forms of ethnic music from diverse geographical regions. These dissimilar strains of ethnic music are commonly categorized together by virtue of their indigenous roots. Over the 20th century, the invention of sound recording, low-cost international air travel and common access to global communication among artists and the general public has given rise to a related phenomenon called "crossover" music. Musicians from diverse cultures and locations could readily access recorded music from around the world, see and hear visiting musicians from other cultures and visit other countries to play their own music, creating a melting pot of stylistic influences. While communication technology allows greater access to obscure forms of music, the pressures of commercialization also present the risk of increasing musical homogeneity, the blurring of regional identities, and the gradual extinction of traditional local music-making practices.</p>

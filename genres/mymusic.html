            <h1>MY MUSIC</h1>

            <p>The idea of producing my own music was born in 2009, shortly after discovering the world of electronic music. This type of music was fascinating to me as we could generate any soundwave possible according to the laws of physics. The possibilites were literally endless, and I thought to myself "How do people make this stuff? I wanna make this stuff too!" and thus the Static Juice project came into existence. What does the name Static Juice even mean and where did it come from? Well, one day while I was riding the bus home from school, my friend and I started talking about possible producer names. I came up with the Static part, he came up with the Juice bit, and I've stuck with the name ever since. It doesn't really mean anything, they were just two words I thought sounded cool together. The initial learning curve was pretty steep and it wasn't until the end of 2011 that I finally released my first track. In September 2014, the album which we know of today began &ndash; The Adventure Album. I don't really know why I called it that. But when I finally finished my album in February 2018, I realized that making the album was the real adventure all along :P</p>

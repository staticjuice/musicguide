                <h1>GOSPEL</h1>

                <p>The very first popular music genres came from a variety of influences but the foundations were laid in the United States. Before Blues and Jazz developed themselves, a number of "proto-genres" responsible for that development were already known and popular throughout the country &ndash; Ragtime, Stride, Jug Bands and Skiffle. But the most important one was Gospel. Gospel evolved from the fragile voice from black slaves into an undeniably huge genre with many subgenres. Gospel shakes off pretty fast its racial dimension &ndash; black and white join hand-in-hand to sing the song of God. Because Gospel is more about faith than about race &ndash; about believing in a better world and future and connecting different souls.</p>

                <p>As Gospel expands and diversifies, questions are raised about the integrity of some artists and the music itself. Are some in it for the money or do they really speak the word of the Lord? Nowadays, Gospel is rarely a part of mainstream music media but without it, there would be no Rhythm &amp; Blues or perhaps even no popular music at all. However, in many churches and religious communities (especially in the southern part of the US) Gospel lives on strongly and is heavily produced, sung and experienced in sermons that induce ecstatic bliss in listeners, the likes other subcultures have never seen.</p>

                <p>Though Gospel is already eclectic on its own, almost every popular music genre &ndash; from Rap to Metal &ndash; has been reshaped into a Gospel subgenre. Therefore a precise definition of Gospel in a broad sense is lacking, but the genre has some characteristics. Vocals for example, are usually sung in a "call-and-response" manner &ndash; a legacy from old church sermons, where the priest sings one part and the choir responds that same part. Not to create a cappella backbeat rhythm (although it was), but simply because of the fact that most church attendants were illiterate. Early Gospel only had piano accompaniment. Percussion was achieved by voice and handclapping. However, one should not underestimate the amount of rhythm achieved in traditional Gospel, another key characteristic of the music. Other pioneering popular music genres work with whatever set-up they could find or afford &ndash; easy to produce instruments like banjo or sometimes rudimentary tools such as washboards, kazoos or jugs. Modern or Contemporary Gospel draws cues from any genre and therefore works with a whole variety of instruments.</p>

                <p>The word "gospel" comes from two Old English words &ndash; "good" (which lost a vowel and became misinterpreted for the word God) and "spel", which means a story or a message. Thus gospel is actually the same word as godspel or goodspel &ndash; fortunate news. This etymology is quite interesting, because it transcends Gospel's religious (and narrow) dimension &ndash; the music is first and foremost a bringer of good news, no matter what faith one has &ndash; a herald of joy. And this is the power of Gospel &ndash; Gospel gathers people together, incites a sense of community and inspires to do good, to bring good and to feel good.</p>

                <p>Gospel is frequently forgotten as a supergenre in music genealogies, pushed away by bigger and more dominant families such as Blues, R&amp;B or Jazz. The collection of Gospel music is substantial though, with countless artists &ndash; even today &ndash; connected by their Christian faith. However, Gospel has taken on so many forms and styles that a common ground besides the message is sometimes hard to find. As the oldest popular music genre &ndash; the matriarch &ndash; it should be no wonder that Gospel has changed substantially throughout the years, but it has survived for more than a century &ndash; an accomplishment other genres still have to achieve.</p>

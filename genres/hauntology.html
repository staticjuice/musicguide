                <h1>HAUNTOLOGY</h1>

                <p>Hauntology is a genre or loose category of music that evokes cultural memory and the aesthetics of the past. It developed in the 2000s primarily among British electronic musicians, and typically draws on British cultural sources from the 1940s to the 1970s, including library music, film and TV soundtracks, psychedelia, and public information films, often through the use of sampling. The term was derived from philosopher Jacques Derrida's concept of the same name. In the mid-2000s, it was adapted by theorists Simon Reynolds and Mark Fisher. Music genres Hypnagogic Pop, Vaporwave and Chillwave descended from Hauntology.</p>

                <p>Hauntology is most associated with a particular British electronic music trend, though it may apply to any art concerned with the aesthetics of the past. The trend is often tied to notions of retrofuturism, whereby artists evoke the past by utilising the spectral sounds of old music technology. The trend involves the sampling of older sound sources to evoke deep cultural memory. Critic Simon Reynolds stated that this strand of "ghostified" music doesn’t quite constitute a genre, a scene, or even a network. It is more of a flavour or atmosphere than a style with boundaries, although he summarised it as a largely British genre of eerie electronics fixated on ideas of decaying memory and lost futures. In contrast, Adam Harper stated that Hauntology is not a genre of art or music, but an aesthetic effect, a way of reading and appreciating art.</p>

                <p>Hauntological music draws on varied postwar cultural sources from the past which lie outside the usual canon of popular music, including library music, film and television soundtracks, educational music, and the sonic experimentation of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, as well as Electronic and Folk music sources. Other British influences include obscure Musique Concrète composers as well as psychedelia and public information films. Also important is the appropriation of visual iconography from this earlier period, including graphic design elements of school textbooks, public information posters, and television idents. Artists typically use vintage recording devices such as cassettes and synthesisers. Production often foregrounds the grain of the recording, including vinyl noise and tape hiss derived from the degraded musical or spoken word samples commonly used. Sampling is used to evoke "dead presences" which are transformed into eerie sonic markers. Artists often mix antique synthesiser tones, acoustic instruments, and digital techniques, as well as found sounds, abstract noise, and industrial drones.</p>

                <p>Hauntological music is described as "an attempt to evoke a nostalgia for a future that never came to pass, with a vision of a strange, alternate world, constituted from the reordered refuse of the postwar period" by The Oxford Handbook of Music and Virtuality. Simon Reynolds described it as an attempt to construct a "lost utopianism" rooted in visions of a benevolent post-welfare state. Mark Fisher characterised the hauntology movement, calling it contemporary electronic music's confrontation with a cultural impasse or the failure of the future. Fisher stated that when cultural innovation has stalled and even gone backwards, one function of Hauntology is to keep insisting that there are futures beyond postmodernity’s terminal time. When the present has given up on the future, we must listen for the relics of the future in the unactivated potentials of the past. Hauntological music is stated by academic Sean Albeiz to suggest an uncanny mixture of shared but faded cultural memories with sinister undercurrents. Hauntology (along with the hypnagogic movement) was likened to sonic fictions or intentional forgeries, creating half-baked memories of things that never were, approximating the imprecise nature of memory itself.</p>

                <p>The 21st century microgenre explosion was partly a consequence of software advances, faster internet connections, and the globalised proliferation of music. By the early 2010s, most microgenres would be linked and defined through various outlets on the Internet. Examples of these include Chillwave, Witch House, Seapunk, Vaporwave and Cloud Rap. Pitchfork's Jonny Coleman commented &ndash; "The line between a real genre that sounds fake and a fake genre that could be real is as thin as ever, if existent at all. This is the uncanny genre valley that publicists-cum-neologicians live in and for." PopMatters' Thomas Britt argued that the "staggering number of niches created by writers and commenters to distinguish musical acts is ultimately binding. If a band plays along and tailors itself to a category, then its fortunes are likely tied to the shelf life of that category."</p>

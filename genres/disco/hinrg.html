            <p>It was only a matter of time before the New Wave movement would spin out of control. At the far end of the spectrum was Hi-NRG &ndash; a type of Disco or Synthpop where there was absolutely no trace of Rock left to find. This was pure Pop music &ndash; slickly produced Synthpop melodies driven by the pulsing rhythm of drum machines. Over-the-top, decadent and ecstatic Post-Disco and Proto-House indulged in a world of fashion, discotheques and upper class style and heavily associated with homosexual parties. Hi-NRG is much faster and more high-pitched compared to regular Disco. Thereâ€™s also very little bass, but a constant repetitive rhythm made futuristic by modulations. A specific trademark of Hi-NRG was the "megamix" &ndash; ultralong edits consisting of different songs mixed together to create a non-stop dancing machine. Megamixes were made possible by the introduction of the 12 inch LP single, allowing longer tracks to be released on single. These mixes showcased producers who became the very first electronic dance DJs.</p>

            <p>Spacesynth is the fusion of Disco music with futuristic themes, sounds and visuals, a genre that became popular in the early 80s. The main idea behind the genre is that of an exploration of the wonders of outer space by humans, and many bands often included robotic shapes, laser illumination and computer screen sequences in their live performances. The artists themselves often dressed in a manner inspired by Glam Rock and futuristic fashion. Upon reaching Eastern Europe, the futuristic act was mainly dropped as many state authorities often denied access to the stage for "inappropriately" dressed artists. Many bands then began performing at free, open-music events, festivals and formations to avoid political suppression, and the genre itself was slowly assimilated into a purely instrumental, almost orchestral form. In the early 90s, Spacesynth started to lose its popularity and almost completely vanished when Eurodance and other Dance genres were dominating the electronic music charts. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the sound with genres such as Synthwave.</p>

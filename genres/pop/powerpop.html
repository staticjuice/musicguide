            <h1>POWER POP</h1><div class="quaternary-year pop-light">1967</div>

            <p>Power Pop, one of the first true Pop Rock genres, is in fact a revival of Beat, a second British Invasion so to speak. However, you can hear an important difference &ndash; the riffs are played with short, energetic strokes, enhanced by fast, repetitive drum beats. It typically incorporates melodic hooks, vocal harmonies, an energetic performance, and cheerful sounding music underpinned by a sense of yearning, longing, despair, or self-empowerment. The emergence of Power Pop and the early types of Pop Rock that went along with it, must be seen as compensation for the darker, more serious types of Rock popping up in the UK in the early 70s. To steer the people as far away from these "bad" types of Rock as possible, the sound of Power Pop went in the opposite direction &ndash; happy, melodic and light. At the end of the 70s, Power Pop experienced a second wave, and in the 90s a third one. Original Power Pop served as a blueprint for many later Pop Rock artists, which were drawn to the bare simplicity of Classic Rock without psychedelic influences or extensive post-production.</p>

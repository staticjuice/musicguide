            <h1>CLASSIC ROCK</h1><br>

            The Golden Age of Rock or Classic Rock are terms not frequently used, but there is no debate about their meaning. Rock completely erupts in an unimaginable way in the sixties, which was so dominant that it still is considered by many music journalists as the most important popular music genre. Since this age, many music magazines, festivals, and books mention the adjective “Rock” as a portmanteau for all popular music. A lot of artists are still performing this very day and have become true Rock legends. In fact, the only ones that have stopped to do so are those who are dead. A proof of the passion these artists have for their music and the justification of the term “Golden Age”.<br><br>

            A large concurrence of events lies at the core of Classic Rock’s revolution. The aftershock of World War II starts to fade since 1958 and a long period of prosperity ensues. A belief in a better future, i.e. a world of peace and happiness, forms the blueprints of a strong countercultural hippie movement. Amphetamines (extensively used during WWII) became cheaper, more popular, more produced and remained legal until 1971. Amphetamines not only shaped Rock ‘n’ Roll but all Rock into the most energetic music at the time, whereas the popularity of psychedelic drugs led to experimentation and genre differentiation. The contraceptive pill, invented in 1960, was one of the greatest pivotal moments of female emancipation of all time. In that same year, the British government relinquished the army service for boys. In one lucky strike, both the (British) female and male youth was liberated. Needless to say, the culmination of all these events resulted in a decade-long party, of which no-one wanted to experience the hangover.<br><br>

            Because of these historic events, most Classic Rock genres originated in the UK, but Rock quickly became hugely popular across the ocean. Legendary Rock neighborhoods of joy and libertinism, such as the Haight Ashbury District, San Francisco, or Soho, London, proved sublime spawning pools for talent. In the UK, pirate radios start playing Rock music since 1964. Immediately, a notion of “rebelliousness” was identified with the music. In 1967 the government shuts down these radio stations, causing the gap between Pop and Rock to widen (radio vs live / mainstream vs alternative).<br><br>

            Classic Rock further incorporates elements from Blues and R&amp;B and the universal blueprint for Rock takes hold. The music becomes more structured with a sequential pattern (verse-chorus-verse-chorus-break/solo-chorus), although the complete opposite was also true (Prog Rock and experimental Acid Rock, which could lack any sort of structure).<br><br>

            Typical about the Golden Age of Rock is the arrival of multi-tracking recording studios. Multi-tracking allows the composer to record different parts of the song and edit them separately. First there were only three tracks, soon four, then eight, and now 24+ is the standard. With multi-tracking one could also record, play and record again (overdubbing) to create a richer or “thicker” sound. Many other techniques suddenly became possible: time alteration, cutting, looping, echo, leslie speakers, etc. During the era of Classic Rock, all these pioneering techniques allowed the creation of music that could not be played live and albums became much more precious than before. They revealed intriguing, out-of-this-world music with experimental (often psychedelic) sounds, further adding to the Rock mania that was already taking place. Famous producers like George Martin, Brian Wilson and Phil Spector were extremely fast in unraveling all the secrets multi-tracking could unfold.<br><br>

            Even more so than in another super-genre, Classic Rock artists cannot be casted within one genre. In this highly experimental age, most artists show work in different genres on the same album. Crossovers from Blues (Blues Rock) to Metal (Classic Metal) make a neat partition of Classic Rock artists largely pointless.

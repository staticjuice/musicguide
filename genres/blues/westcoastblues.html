            <h1>WEST COAST BLUES</h1><div class="quaternary-year blues-light">1945</div>

            <p>West Coast Blues radiates a typically West Coast warm, delicate and rhythmical aura. The genre is heavily based on the piano, yet has also received influences from different genres of Blues thanks to artists migrating to the west. The piano can be accompanied or replaced by a Blues guitar but this is typically played more jazzily. More piano-based and Jazz-influenced than anything else, West Coast Blues is &ndash; in actuality &ndash; the California style, with all of the genre's main practitioners coming to prominence there, if not actual natives of the state in particular. In fact, the state and the style played host to a great many post-war Texas guitar expatriates and their jazzy, T-Bone Walker style of soloing would become an earmark of the genre. West Coast Blues also features smooth, honey-toned vocals, frequently crossing into Chicago Blues territory. The West Coast style was also home to numerous Jump Blues practitioners, as many travelling bands of the 40s ended up taking permanent residence there. Its current practitioners work almost exclusively in the standard small-combo format.</p>

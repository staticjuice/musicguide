            <h1>SCOTTISH FOLK</h1>

            <p>Scottish Folk is music that uses forms that are identified as part of the Scottish musical tradition. There is evidence that there was a flourishing culture of popular music in Scotland during the late Middle Ages, but the only song with a melody to survive from this period is the "Pleugh Song". After the Reformation, the secular popular tradition of music continued, despite attempts by the Kirk &ndash; particularly in the Lowlands &ndash; to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings. The first clear reference to the use of the Highland bagpipes mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in the mid 16th century. The Highlands in the early 17th century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmons, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. This tradition continued into the 19th century, with major figures such as the fiddlers Neil and his son Nathaniel Gow. Musically, there tends to be a lot of crossover between the Irish and Scottish Folk traditions due to their similar culture. As such, sometimes both styles are lumped under the umbrella term of Celtic Folk.</p>

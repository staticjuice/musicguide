            The middle ground between Breakbeat and Drum ‘n’ Bass has led to a whole group of music genres that can be considered a super-genre on its own: UK Garage (with the inclusion of UK Bass). UK Garage started as an experiment to renew Drum ‘n’ Bass with influences from other EDM such as Breakbeat and Garage House, but soon evolved into a broad and separate subculture with Dubstep as its most well-known exponent. UK Garage experiments with different, unexpected rhythms (like 2-step), creating highly syncopated breakbeat music with a variety of influences to provide treble and a strong Drum ‘n’ Bass influence to provide ultra-deep bass. The latest forms of UK Bass thrive in a strong underground internet culture. With artist names impossible to pronounce and sometimes even requiring special ALT or ASCII keys to type, the underground network of pirate radio’s which made Drum ‘n’ Bass great in the mid-nineties, seems to have been resurrected in a new form.

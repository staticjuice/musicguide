                <h1>UK GARAGE</h1>

                <p>Although Breakbeat is a genre defined by its technical rhythm component, there is an underlying racial aspect at stake. Just like Rock &amp; Roll is a white translation of black Rhythm &amp; Blues, so is Breakbeat the "Caucasian" version of black Hip Hop music. Though this division is not as strong as the Rock &amp; Roll / R&amp;B polarity (many black artists are involved in making Breakbeat), it is remarkable how the overwhelming majority of Hip Hop artists are black, while the overwhelming majority of Breakbeat artists are white (considering the fact that these two supergenres are so closely related to each other). This has spurred the necessity of a true "black Dance music genre", leading to Jungle. Breakbeat is arguably the most difficult supergenre to outline, being propelled by eager experimental artists with highly eclectic music taste.</p>

                <p>Most Breakbeat is regarded as a part of Hip Hop culture, as (just like Hip Hop) it is also based on the sampling of Funk records to make breakbeats and mostly thrives in the same subculture with corresponding techniques (such as turntablism) or elements (such as graffiti or breakdancing).</p>

                <p>The word "breakbeat" is derived from the section of early Funk or Disco records where all instruments stop playing (breaking) and only the drummer and percussion remains, called the "breakdown". Such a breakdown section could be used by both Hip Hop and Breakbeat artists to create their own drum samples without the use of a real drummer and before the advent of affordable drum machine. Some samples became more frequently used as Breakbeat building blocks than others and received their own name and legendary status. The "Amen Break" for example, is a well-known sample from the Winston's Funk single "Amen" from 1969. James Brown's most outspoken breakdown in "Funky Drummer" became the basis for the "Funky Drummer Break". Honey Drippers with "Impeach the President", "Synthetic Substitution" by Melvin Bliss and "Apache" by The Incredible Bongo Band are all rather unknown Funk records, yet technically the most played records of all time due to a countless amount of resampling.</p>

                <p>Hip Hop and Breakbeat artists particularly like Funk and Disco breakdowns instead of Rock or Blues ones as these funky drummers introduced "the third beat" &ndash; placing kick drums on different beats than in a straight 4/4 rhythm. Both kick drums and snare drums fall on different beats in different bars, with hi-hat on the offbeat, creating an asymmetrical pattern. Breakbeat differs from instrumental Hip Hop in a slightly higher speed (110-120 BPM) and a heavier use of samples, sound effects and sound manipulation, all placed in different layers at the right point to compose an intricate rhythmical web. This means that Breakbeat tracks are usually too rich and layered to allow rapping on top of them. Take note &ndash; harder, more Dance-oriented versions of Breakbeat varying between 120-140 BPM exist as well and are easily distinguishable from Hip Hop.</p>

                <p>The middle ground between Breakbeat and Drum &amp; Bass has led to a whole group of music genres that can be considered a supergenre on its own &ndash; UK Garage (with the inclusion of UK Bass). UK Garage started as an experiment to renew Drum &amp; Bass with influences from other EDM such as Breakbeat and Garage House, but soon evolved into a broad and separate subculture with Dubstep as its most well-known exponent. UK Garage experiments with different, unexpected rhythms (like 2-Step), creating highly syncopated breakbeat music with a variety of influences to provide treble and a strong Drum &amp; Bass influence to provide ultra-deep bass. The latest forms of UK Bass thrive in a strong underground internet culture. With artist names impossible to pronounce and sometimes even requiring special ALT or ASCII keys to type, the underground network of pirate radios which made Drum &amp; Bass great in the mid-90s, seems to have been resurrected in a new form.</p>
